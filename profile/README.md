## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who blends structure with personality. I specialize in scalable Discord bots, real-time systems, and self-hosted platforms. I believe minimalism, performance, and aesthetics can coexist — in code and in identity.

- Focused on JavaScript (ESM-first), Node.js, and Redis
- Passionate about building things that are fast, private, and self-contained
- Designing infrastructure that’s expressive and functional

## Projects

- **Pepe** – Large-scale multipurpose Discord bot (Redis, SQLite, sharded)
- **Polaris** – Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text agent
- **Slot-based Panels** – OAuth2 login, slot plans, auto plan detection by Discord roles
